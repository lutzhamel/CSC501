For the majority of the course we will rely on Prolog skills.  We will use ``Programming in Prolog: Using The Iso Standard'', 5th Edition, by Clocksin and Mellish.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Objectives}

The aim of this course is to
\begin{itemize}
\item Familiarize you with the basic techniques of applying formal methods to programming languages.

\item This includes constructing models for programming languages and using these models to prove properties such as correctness and equivalence of programs.

\item Look at all major programming language constructs including assignments, loops, type systems, and function calls together with their models.

\item Introduce mechanical theorem proving assistants so that we can test and prove properties of non-trivial programs.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Semantics}
\vspace{.1in}
{\bf Programming Language Semantics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Programming language semantics refers to the rules and principles that define the {\bf meaning and behavior} of a programming language. 

\item
It provides a formal specification of how programs written in a particular programming language should be executed or interpreted. 

\item
Semantics help programmers and programming language implementers understand how code should behave, allowing for correct and predictable program execution.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Formal Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\bf Formal methods} refer to a set of mathematical techniques and tools used in computer science and software engineering to specify, design, and verify software and hardware systems. 

\item
These methods employ rigorous and precise mathematical models to describe system behavior and properties, aiming to improve the reliability, correctness, and safety of complex systems. 

\item
Formal methods are particularly valuable in critical systems where errors can have severe consequences, such as in aerospace, healthcare, and automotive industries.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Formal Methods}


Key components of formal methods include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
{\bf Formal Specification:} This involves the use of  {\bf formal systems} to precisely define the requirements and behavior of a system. Formal specifications eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear, unambiguous representation of system functionality.

\item
{\bf Modeling:} Formal methods often use mathematical models, such as finite state machines,  logic, and set theory, to represent the behavior and structure of a system. Models enable the analysis of system properties, such as correctness and safety.

\item
{\bf Verification:} Formal methods allow for the rigorous verification of system properties and requirements. This can include formal proofs of correctness, model checking, and theorem proving to ensure that a system adheres to its specified behavior and constraints.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Formal Systems}
\begin{itemize}
\item
A {\bf formal system} consists of a {\em formal language} and a set of  {\em inference rules}.
The formal language is composed of
primitive symbols that make up well formed formulas and the inference rules are used to derive expressions from other expressions within the formal system. 

\item
These systems are employed in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, logic, linguistics, and philosophy, to provide a precise and rigorous means of reasoning and constructing proofs.

\item
In order to be truly useful in computer science, we require our formal systems to be {\em machine executable}.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}[fragile]{Observations}
When programming we can observe two mental activities:
\begin{itemize}
\item We construct {\em correct looking} programs - {\em syntactically} correct programs.
\item We construct {\em models} of the intended computation in our minds. Consider,
\bcode
x := 1
while (x <= 10) do
     writeln(x)
     x := x + 1
end whiledo
\ecode
Any person with some familiarity of programming immediately has a mental picture that this program
will generate a list of integers from 1 through 10.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Programming Language Definitions}

Mirroring our intuition, language definitions consist of two parts:

\begin{itemize}

\item
{\bf Syntax:} The formal description of the
{\bf structure} of  well-formed expressions, phrases, programs, etc.

\item
{\bf Semantics:} The formal description of the {\bf  meaning} of the syntactic features of a programming language
usually understood in terms of the runtime {\bf behavior} each syntactic construct evokes.  The formal description of the behavior of all
the syntactic features of a language is considered a {\bf model} of the language.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Evaluation/Interpretation}
Syntax and semantics of a programming language are usually related via an {\em evaluation relation}
or {\em interpretation}, say $h$.  Then we say that the interpretation $h$ takes each syntactic element and
maps it into the appropriate semantic construct.

\vspace{.1in}

We often represent this with the diagram
\[
\xymatrix{
&\mathit{Semantics}\\
\mathit{(Background)}& \mathit{Syntax}\ar[u]^h
}
\]
{\bf Note:} In order for the interpretation $h$ to make any sense we will have to define the syntax and
semantics in terms of sets.

{\bf Note:} Syntax is often evaluated in the context of some background like machine state.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Formal Systems and Programs}

The formal systems we will be using in this course are:
\begin{itemize}
\item First-order logic extended with {\bf natural deduction} -- natural semantics.
\item Horn Clause Logic as implemented by Prolog, a subset of first-order logic.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Readings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Read Chapter 0 in "Denotational Semantics" by David Schmidt (available from the course website).
\item Read Sections 2.1 and 2.2 in "Denotational Semantics" by David Schmidt.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
